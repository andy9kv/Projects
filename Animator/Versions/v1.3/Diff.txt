Differences between Version 1.2 & Version 1.3:

    -Finished working on a TerminalOutput.java, a class to print a
     Scene Graph to the terminal
    -Renamed TerminalOutput.java to StringOutput.java
    -Can now successfully, albeit it in a very basic level, display
     SceneGraphs to the terminal
 	-Fixed a bug in the transformation process (RTS instead of RST)
 	-Fixed a bug in the SceneGraph copy constructor
 	-Created a dedicated FlipbookList instead of an ArrayList for
 	 the Flipbook class (Linked List with Generics)
 	-Fixed other bugs in the Flipbook class
 	-Added functionality to retrive transformation values from formed
 	 transformation matrices
 	-Finished adding the functionality to Flipbook.java to automatically
 	 create an animation from just two or three images
 	-Added global variable originalFrames to Flipbook.java to track
 	 the difference of the manually added frames and the automatically
 	 added ones

 	 Version 1.3 will be the last 1st-generation version since there is
 	 not much more to be done as long as scene/animation output is to
 	 the terminal 

 	-PROBLEM:
 		-No Fill for shapes (Will not implement in version 1)
 		-"Pixel" count is too low for smooth animation
