Differences between Version 1.1 & Version 1.2:

	-Fixed SG copy constructor (very heavily used)
	-Addressed many uniqueID issues, including:
		-Created constructors in the Node class that resolved the
	 	 uniqueID issue upon creation
	 	-Fixed the comparison in SceneGraph.buildLeaf to compare nodes
	 	 by their uniqueID instead of names
	 	-Made sure that all instances of node creation included 
	 	 establishing uniqueIDs
    -Began working on a TerminalOutput.java, a class to print a
     Scene Graph to the terminal, still not finished with bugs
