#### Here are some of my personal projects


The current folder is a collection of md files that fully explain my (more or less) finished projects and link to the code/relevant material. For projects without respective md files (some md files are under construction), the fully commented code can be found [here](/Project_Files/).

#### Notable "Finished" Projects

* [Traffic Sign Detection](Traffic%20Sign%20Detection.md) (Python using OpenCV, NumPy) - Wrote a program to detect traffic signs in a video quickly and efficiently, exclusively using computer vision techniques such as gradients, edge maps and histograms, color thresholding, etc.
* [Automatic Nautical Flag Recognition](Automatic%20Flag%20Recognition.md) (C++ using Microsoft Visual Studio, OpenCV) - Program to scan an image and determine which (if any) international nautical flags are present by color filtering, pattern matching, and applying localized histograms to recognize each flagsâ€™ distinct form.
* [Independently Moving Object Tracking](Independently%20Moving%20Object%20Tracking.md) (Python using OpenCV, NumPy) - Developed a program to track a moving object in a video via feature correspondence and adaptive thresholding

#### In-Progress Projects

##### 8-bit computer

I am in the process of finishing an 8-bit computer (on a bunch of breadboards tied together) simliar to Intel's 8085 processor from 1976. Although its an old processor, many of the underlying concepts are used by modern processors. I'm builidng the computer using only basic digital and sequential logic gates. Videos explaining how the computer works and the assembly language I developed for it are coming soon!

##### Organized Peer-to-Peer File Sharing System

A Content-Addressable Network (CAN) is a decentralized and distributed peer-to-peer hash table (DHT) that eliminates redundency and optimizes accress time. Simliar implementations are used by software like Napster. This project is essentially an implementation of the [original paper](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sylvia/papers/cans.pdf) introducing a CAN.

##### Autonomous Drone

I am designing, building, and programming an autonomous drone (quadcopter) which will be controlled by observing people's gestures using several computer vision techniques through a set of cameras on its chassis
