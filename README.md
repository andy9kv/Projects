#### Here are some of my personal projects


The current folder is a collection of md files that fully explain the projects and link to the code/relevant material. For projects without respective md files (some md files are under construction), the fully commented code can be found [here](http://github.com/andy9kv/Projects/Project_Files).


#### In-Progress Projects

##### 8-bit computer

I am in the process of finishing an 8-bit computer (on a bunch of breadboards tied together) simliar to Intel's 8085 processor from 1976.
Although its an old processor, many of the concepts are the same ones that are in use now. I'm builidng the computer using only basic digital and sequential logic gates. Videos explaining how the computer works are coming soon!

##### Organized Peer-to-Peer File Sharing System

A Content-Addressable Network (CAN) is a decentralized peer-to-peer hash table that eliminates redundency and optimizes accress time. Simliar implementations are used by software like Napster.
