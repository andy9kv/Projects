#### Here are some of my personal projects


Some md files that explain the projects and give instructions to run them are under construction!
(looking in the folders probably won't tell you much, but you can read the code)



#### Finished Notable Projects

##### Traffic-Sign Detector

##### Independently-Moving Object Tracker

##### Nautical Flag Recognition

#### In-Progress Projects

##### 8-bit computer

I am in the process of finishing an 8-bit computer (on a bunch of breadboards tied together) simliar to Intel's 8085 processor from 1976.
Although its an old processor, many of the concepts are the same ones that are in use now. I'm builidng the computer using only basic digital and sequential logic gates. Videos explaining how the computer works are coming soon!

##### Organized Peer-to-Peer File Sharing System

A Content-Addressable Network (CAN) is a decentralized peer-to-peer hash table that eliminates redundency and optimizes accress time. Simliar implementations are used by software like Napster.
