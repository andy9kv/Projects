# Traffic Sign Detection

Sign detection, recognition, and identification is imperative for many autonomous robots such as self-driving cars. To solve this problem, in many cases, learning-based approaches are favored where there are no explicit, human-given instructions rather machine-derived solutions. This approach is different in that it relies exclusivly on computer vision techniques to detect (not identify) traffic signs. This project was a team project where each member presented different solutions to the problem (associated [white paper](/Project_Files/Traffic_Sign_Detection/whitepaper.pdf)). The following is my solution.

## Architecture



## Implementation

## Demos

## Run it yourself
