Notes on the Animator Projects

-Add a uniqueID to all nodes. No two nodes, past or present, across different Scene Graphs, can have the same ID, unless they are a node that has been copied, which means there must be some kind of method of keeping track of new ID's between scenes, perhaps to be introduced in the Flipbook class

To Do List
	-rewrite AddEditedNode, which includes findByPosition, getPosition, and checkLevel
	-Make the number of Polygon vertices immutable
	-write the autoBridgeScenes method

Problems with unique ID

	-can give other nodes the same id when copying but,
	-how to make sure that new created nodes do not accidently get an ID that is in use?

Possible Solutions
	
	-perhaps each new node can request a number from the flipbook class?
	-perhaps upon getting a new id, a node should check with all other nodes? (very costly)
	-perhaps the nodes can get random IDs that change upon being added to the flipbook?
