 -------- A Maximum-Cut Approximation via Greedy Alogirthms ---------

  Greedy Algorithms

        Greedy algoithms refer to any algorithm that blindly selects
    the best option presented to it at any given moment. There are
    numerous variations to this, but the naÃ¯ve greedy approach is the
    one that picks the best choice now.

  Claire Mathieu's and Warren Schudy's Greedy Approximation

	    Given an undirected graph G = (V, E) with a positive integer
	weight on each edge, the goal is to find a partition (A, B) of
	the vertex set such that the weight of all edges with one end in
	A and the other in B is maximized. This problem is NP-hard. To
	solve this problem with a greedy approach, Mathie and Warren
	propose the following solution in "Yet Another Algorithm for
	Dense Max Cut: Go Greedy".

	    This greedy approach considers vertices one by one in random
	fashion and places them in one partition or the other depending
	on the edge weights to neighbors that are already in each of the
	partitions. Each vertex in placed in the partition that maximizes
	the value of the cut. For example, say vertex v has neighbors x
	and y in partition A and has neighbors u and w in parition B,
	with an edge weight of 5 to x, 6 to y, 3 to u, and 7 to w. Thus,
	when placing vertex v in a partition, we see that it has a total
	weight of 11 to parition A and 10 to parition B. According to
	this algoirthm, vertex v would be placed in partition B to take
	advantage of v's greater edge weight to partition A, maximizing
	the value of the cut from A to B. After all vertices are
	randomaly placed in one partition or the other, we have our max
	cut approximation.

	    One variation invovles repeating this process multiple times
	and selecting the best resulting cut. If repeated enough times,
	namely 2^2^poly(n) times, we could guarantee near-optimality,
	however this would be quite slow and therefore useless as an
	efficient approximation.
