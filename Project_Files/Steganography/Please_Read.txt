Notes on Project:

	-image.c has warings when compiled. I did not fix this since we were instructed not to mess with image.c
	-command: make or make Stego creates executable Stego
	-command: make StegoExtract creates executable StegoExtract
	-command: make clean removes all executables, object files, and create a clean copy of Img1.pgm and Img2.pgm called Stego1.pgm and Stego2.pgm. A recomended cycle would look like this:
		make
		Stego Img1.pgm Stego1.pgm payload1.txt
		make StegoExtract
		StegoExtract Stego1.pgm out.txt
		make clean
		//make out.txt empty(Makefile does not do this)
