
This implementaion, which took some time to do and plan,
unfortunately followed the idea of bordering an image
by using a smart directional switching technique which
was supposed to detect exactly when the processes of
bordering an image should switch directions, i.e. to
know when to bend right to keep the edge or bend back
to direction x, direction y, etc. It was abandoned
because an implementation that was finally promesing
and "beyond doubt" did not work and the code was so
big and ugly that it was abandoned for a simpler
and easier approach (even more effiecient). Bug fixing
seemed to be a daugnting task and such it was buried

This one really hurt to let go because I put a lot of
time, effort, planning, and intellignece into it but
letting what has become a "part of me" (at least for
some weeks) go is one of the most essential skills a
programmer can have
